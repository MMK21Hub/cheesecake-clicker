# 🍰 Cheesecake clicker

> A clicker game inspired by our favourite dessert

## Project motivation

Clicker games are pretty fun, and I wanted to use my web development skills to make my own one from scratch.

My friends wanted a leaderboard, so I decided to learn to use ✨ Airtable ✨ and Cloudflare Workers to create a leaderboard system. This isn't ready, but you can take a look at the middleware code in my [`cheesecake-worker`](https://github.com/MMK21Hub/cheesecake-worker) repository.
